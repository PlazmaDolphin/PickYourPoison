1. Player Movement
    Control using WASD
        Listen to WASD keys
        Set velocity based on direction
    Animate character
        Running
        Idle
        Running backwards?
    Move Camera
2. Aim with Mouse
    Track Mouse position
    Put cursor img on mouse
    Face character towards mouse
3. Make enemy [Prefab]
    Track health
    Track collisions
    Enemy AI (figure out later)
    Type weakness / (resistance?)
    Check if dead when hit
        groan.wav
        IF everyone dead, win
4. Weak Punch
    Listen for LMB
    Swing in cursor direction
    Do punch animation
    swing.wav
    Check for collision with enemy
        Damage enemy
        Play enemy hurt animation
        punchhit.wav
5. Drink [Prefab]
    Drink img
    Drink Type
    Power bar (where the combos are shown)
    Let player pick up / hold drink
    Drink it!
        Check if drink is held
        Update power bar
        gulp.wav
6. Use powers
    Check power bar
    create effect particle [prefab probably]
    check for enemy collision
    ignore player collision with own powers
[TIM THIS IS YOU]
Make animations work (walk, idle, punch)
replace headbutt with punch animation
make potions drop on ground
let player pick up potion with [i dont care what key just pick one] if close enough
delete ground potion when picked up
transition to potion animations when holding potion
make a UI element to display what potions have been swallowed (the power bar)
    [the image will likely get replaced by Sean but the logic will stay]
swallow potion [other key idc which (right-click?)], updating power bar and removing potion from hand
[IF THERE IS TIME GET PAST HERE]
use power
    reuse punch animation for the magic
    spawn fireball GameObject
    give initial trajectory from character's position to cursor
    detect collision with enemies and damage them
    collision with wall or enemy = fireball dead
1 FIRE = Fireball (small)
2 FIRE = Fire Breath (big)
[WE NEED TO DO THESE PARTS TOGETHER]
Enemy AI:
    Some move towards player and melee attack
    Others keep distance and use potions [OPTIONAL]
    Throw rocks at you??????
Title Screen
Cutscenes
